> 1. Used by [gurus](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/G/guru.html) to brush off questions they consider trivial or annoying. Compare [Don't do that then!](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/D/Don-t-do-that-then-.html).
> 2. Used when reporting a problem to indicate that you aren't just asking out of [randomness](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/R/randomness.html). "No, I can't figure out how to interface Unix to my toaster, and yes, I have RTFM." Unlike sense 1, this use is considered polite.
