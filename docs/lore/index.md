# Lore

ProgSoc has a long history full of lore. This is a collection of some of it, assembled with the combined efforts of previous society members spanning the years and current members.

ProgSoc is over 30 years old and, as time has passed many people have cycled through and I'm sure there are more than a few interesting stories yet untold. If you have any stories you'd like to share, please feel free to add them to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/progsoc/docs) or send them to the [ProgSoc committee](mailto:progsoc@activateuts.com.au). There's also a guide on [contributing](./contributing).

For stories that may not be constrained to a single page, they'll get their own page and be linked to from here.

## 1989-1990

In 2019 ProgSoc celebrated its 30th anniversary. To celebrate, many previous and current members of the club got together to share stories and reminisce about the good old days. For the 30th anniversary one of the founding members, Roland Turner (VP 1989/1990) spent some time between conference talks to record a message reflecting on the early days of ProgSoc.
