## 2. Approving Minutes

1. Chair or Minute-taker reads/shows details of previous general meeting,
2. Chair calls for vote of acceptance,
3. Minute-taker records vote.


## 3. Motions

Where not otherwise specified, votes will be decided by a simple majority (>50%).

### Notice

Some motions, such as constitutional amendments, will have been given to the secretary with notice (see constitution [§ 8.2. AMENDMENT OF CONSTITUTION - Amendment Notice](https://progsoc.org/constitution#82-amendment-notice)).

### Constitutional Amendments

Before any such motions are to be put, the chair will read the relevant sections in the constitution regarding amendment process:

* [§ 8.1. AMENDMENT OF CONSTITUTION - Amendments](https://progsoc.org/constitution#81-amendments)

The chair announces the threshold (exact number of votes based on total attendees, `2/3 * attendance`) for a successful vote.

The chair then reads out voting procedure for motions successfully seconded:

1. Each attendee shall cast one vote, this will either be FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN,
2. In the case of a tie of FOR and AGAINST, the chair holds an additional casting vote, which should generally be used to preserve the status quo.

Attendees will then be allowed to move amendments (chairs should generally not motion. If the chair is the author, they should ask another attendee to do so in their place).

### Process

The chair will move through motions given notice, calling the motioners for each.

1. An attendee will move an item to be discussed,
    * "I move that the following `<item>` be put: ..."
2. Another attendee must second that motion, otherwise it is lost,
    * "I second the motion."
3. The chair proposes the question,
    * "The motion has been seconded, I propose the question that the `<item>` be put."
4. The room discusses the `<item>`,
    * The author should discuss their intent here,
5. Attendees may move subsidiary motions recursively which must be resolved before proceeding,
    * This can include small changes to the amendment text
5. An attendee will move that the question be put,
6. The chair puts the question,
    * "I put the question that we resolve to `<item>`.
7. A vote will occur,
7. The chair announces the result and the minute-taker records it in the minutes.
    * "This motion is resolved in the AFFIRMATIVE/NEGATIVE"


## 5. Nominations

1. A first-past-the-post vote will be opened,
2. Candidates will exit the room,
3. Every attendee casts a single vote for a single candidate, or they may ABSTAIN,
