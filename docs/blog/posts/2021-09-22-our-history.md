ProgSoc is over 30 years old, having officially started in 1989 with UTS Union (later renamed to Activate UTS). Back then, learning programming was significantly harder, and the field was just emerging into popularity. It was also very difficult to run your own server and have your own website, so ProgSoc provided free website hosting on their own computers to all members! These days, providing free hosting is no longer necessary with companies such as Github and Vercel providing an excellent free service instead, however our mission statement of making programming more accessible to everyone still stays!

Following our old roots, we’re more than ever before providing a place for people to show off their projects and technologies they’ve learned, as well as providing our own workshops and online resources for all members!

### Early beginnings

In 2019, on the 30th anniversary of ProgSoc, Roland Turner (one of the original co-founders) performed a speech where he talked about the early beginnings of ProgSoc and all of the interesting achievements that were possible at the time. The video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWQlqHZgEqE).

### Old website

Until 2021, we had a different website hosted under Apache with PHP, and it was a huge can of worms with different historical services glued together. In 2021, they were all statically archived with a custom crawler and hosted [here](http://oldarchive.progsoc.org/).

Some notable pages include:

*   The [main wiki](https://oldarchive.progsoc.org/wiki/Main_Page) (Mediawiki, 2006-2021)
*   The [old wiki](https://oldarchive.progsoc.org/resources/) (Dokuwiki, ??-2006)
*   [Old user folders](https://oldarchive.progsoc.org/users.html)
*   [Archived mailing lists](https://oldarchive.progsoc.org/pipermail/)
