# UTS Tech Festival Programming Competition

Sponsored by WiseTech Global the UTS Tech Festival Programming Competition was a chance for students to test their skills against their peers in a fun and friendly environment.

It had a set of problems of 12 of varying difficulty and students had an afternoon to solve as many as they could either individually or in teams of up to 4.

The problems and their solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/progsoc/ProgComp2023).
