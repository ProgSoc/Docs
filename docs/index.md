# Welcome to the UTS Programmers' Society!

**ProgSoc is a club for all programmers who want to find fellow coders and learn more about programming! Showcase your skills and get help from other programmers, or just hang out and have fun, even if you're a beginner! We're welcome to all beginners, and are happy to help you learn more about the field, as well as helping out with different programming subjects, or just generally talking about the industry!**
